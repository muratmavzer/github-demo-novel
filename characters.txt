GPT models work as a complex network of artificial neurons, organized in layers to process information deeply, much like the human brain. 
Its architecture is known as a transformer, which is a neural network design that Google researchers invented and open sourced in 2017. 
The transformer allows it to analyze entire sentences simultaneously, rather than sequentially, grasping relationships between words regardless of their distance. 
This ability stems from "self-attention," a mechanism that lets the model weigh the importance of each word in relation to all others, mimicking how humans focus on different parts of a sentence for context.  
Training this model involves feeding it massive amounts of text data—books, articles, code, online conversations—exposing it to the range and nuance of human language. 
Through repeated exposure and a process called "backpropagation," where it learns from its prediction errors, the model refines its internal representation of language, becoming remarkably adept at understanding and generating human-quality text.
Training a GPT model is a computationally intensive process that involves feeding it massive amounts of text data and employing a self-supervised learning approach. The model doesn't rely on explicitly labeled data; instead, it learns by identifying patterns and relationships within the data itself.

The training process typically involves the following steps:

Data preparation: The first step is to gather and prepare a massive dataset of text and code. This dataset is carefully curated to be as diverse and representative as possible, covering a wide range of topics, writing styles, and languages.
Tokenization: The text data is then divided into smaller units called "tokens." These can be individual words, parts of words, or even characters, depending on the specific GPT model and the desired level of granularity.
Model initialization: The GPT model is initialized with random parameters. These parameters will be adjusted during the training process as the model learns from the data.
Self-supervised learning: The model is then fed the tokenized text data and tasked with predicting the next token in a sequence. For example, given the input "The cat sat on the", the model might predict "mat."
Backpropagation and optimization: The model's predictions are compared to the actual next tokens in the training data, and the difference between them is used to calculate a "loss" value. 
This loss represents how far off the model's predictions are from the truth. The model then uses backpropagation to adjust its internal parameters to minimize this loss. This iterative process of prediction, loss calculation, and parameter adjustment continues over many epochs, with the model gradually improving its ability to predict the next token in a sequence accurately.

Nick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota, moves to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business. He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick’s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.

Nick is unlike the other inhabitants of West Egg—he was educated at Yale and has social connections in East Egg, a fashionable area of Long Island home to the established upper class. Nick drives out to East Egg one evening for dinner with his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, an erstwhile classmate of Nick’s at Yale. Daisy and Tom introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, a beautiful, cynical young woman with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship. Nick also learns a bit about Daisy and Tom’s marriage: Jordan tells him that Tom has a lover, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the valley of ashes, a gray industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle. At a vulgar, gaudy party in the apartment that Tom keeps for the affair, Myrtle begins to taunt Tom about Daisy, and Tom responds by breaking her nose.
